    <p class="page-paragraph">
        We are a volunteer‑run cat rescue based in Western Australia, dedicated to helping
        abandoned, stray, and surrendered cats find safe and loving homes.
    </p>

    <p class="page-paragraph">
        Our mission is simple: rescue, rehabilitate, and rehome. We work closely with foster
        carers, vets, and the community to ensure every cat receives the care they deserve.
    </p>

    <p class="page-paragraph">
        Thank you for supporting our work — together, we’re giving cats a second chance.
